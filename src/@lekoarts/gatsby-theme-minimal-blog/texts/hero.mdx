About Me:
</Text>

I love technology because when it works it is a net gain for everyone. Driving new efficiencies, providing new capabilities, enabling new possibilities; due to their scalability, great products have the potential to be completeley transformative in their impact on society.

I work in the field of product management which means that I help technology companies make products that deliver value and drive impact for their users.
In other words I try to make products better for users in both the short and long-term, balancing multiple priorities to hopefully make something great. It also means leading empowered teams of technologists and designers to build the future. This isn't always an easy job but I truly love what I do. Great products make things better.

My personal interests vary from cooking and hiking in nature to cryptocurrency and other technical things. I love BBQ.
